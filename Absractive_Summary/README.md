# Summarization with T5 Model

This project demonstrates text summarization using the T5 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library, integrated with a Streamlit UI for interactive use.

## Overview

The application allows users to input text or URLs. If a URL is provided, it fetches the content from the webpage, processes the text, and generates a summary using the T5 model. For text inputs, it directly generates a summary using the T5 model.

## Features

- Text summarization using the T5 model.
- Handling of URL inputs to fetch and process content.
- Streamlit UI for interactive usage.
