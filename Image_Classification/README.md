# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras on two different datasets: Visual Domain Decathlon and Cat-Dog.

## Overview

The project uses CNNs to classify images into different categories based on the dataset. It includes data loading, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of training/validation accuracy.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing using `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator`.
- CNN model construction with adjustable convolutional layers and image sizes.
- Training and evaluation of the CNN models on two distinct datasets.
- Plotting training and validation accuracy using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
