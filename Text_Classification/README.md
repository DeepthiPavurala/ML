# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis on movie reviews using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview

The project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content. It uses LSTM networks for sequential data processing and TensorFlow/Keras for model building and training.

## Features

- Dataset loading and preprocessing.
- LSTM model construction with adjustable parameters.
- Training and evaluation of the model.
- Visualization of training/validation accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (for train_test_split)
